# EKS Reference Architecture

The configurations captured within this project are intended to serve as references for others to build upon. If you are looking to get started with one or more of the following archtectures, the provided configurations can help users quickly grasp the requirements and concepts.

The configurations provided are not intended to be consumed as a Terraform module, nor are they necessarily designed to be "prodcution ready". The configurations can be greatly expanded to be closer to production ready, but are kept narrow so as to highlight the specific portions that fulfill their respective reference architecture.
