# EKS Reference Architecture

The configurations captured within this project are intended to serve as references for others to build upon. If you are looking to get started with one or more of the following architectures, the provided configurations can help users quickly grasp the configurations used to achieve the desired outcome.

The configurations provided are not intended to be consumed as a Terraform module, nor are they necessarily designed to be "production ready". The configurations can be greatly expanded to be closer to production ready, but are kept narrow and focused on the specific configurations that support the respective reference architecture.
